## Project Description 
A high-quality README is essential when creating an open source project on GitHub. This README Generator both saves developers' time and improve README quality. The Generator enables the user to create a README markdown file with templated sections populated entering text content via the command line. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/readme-generator) for the README Generator code.

## Installation
* You need a GitHub account to access the README Generator code
* Install the README generator by forking the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/grace-anderson/readme-generator) and then cloning the fork to your local repository.
* Then use your favourite command line tool (e.g. Visual Studio, Bash) to cd into the app folder. 
* Run the app by entering `node index.js`. 


## Usage
* Watch this video (link to be added) for more instructions and a demonstration of the README Generator's functionality
* This README Guide provides some great hints and tips for creating a polished README
* After creating the README using the README Generator you may further edit and refine the README markdown file. For example, you may wish to add screenshots to your generated README markdown file
* You may update your local cloned README generator code to customise it to your needs. For example, if you usually list technology in your README add a "Technology" section. Remember you can contribute to the [README Generator project](https://github.com/grace-anderson/readme-generator), following the Contribution Guidelines below.

## Contribution Guidelines
* Contributions are welcome.
* Before contributing, browse through the open issues to see if your issue already exists or if there is an issue you might be able to solve. 
* To contribute, open a new issue describing your proposed enhancement or fix.
* If you're a newbie dev, start contributing by looking for issues labelled "good first issue"
* It is good practice to set up the project repository as an "upstream" remote and to synchronize your local repository with the project repository
* Don't update the main branch. Rather create your own branch using a descriptive brief name
* You can create pull requests, but only admins can review and merge.
* Be nice to your reviewer by adding adding a plain English explanation describing your pull requests and how it addresses the issue/s it concerns
* Also see the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines)

  
## Test Instructions
Use following tests to validate the functionality of the README Generator app.

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input 
1. WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Table of Contents, Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contribution Guidelines, Tests, and Questions
2. WHEN I enter my project title THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
3. WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contribution Guidelines, and Tests
4. WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
5. WHEN I enter my GitHub username THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
6. WHEN I enter my email address THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
7. WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README page.
